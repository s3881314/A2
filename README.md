This is the sysmtem of Able Care Home for staff. In this system, I implemented the GUI and some basic functions.

"DO NOT DELETE AuthorizationList.txt IN Archive"
"DO NOT DELETE root IN DoctorList.txt"

In the system, user can add manager, doctor, nurse and resident with proper authorization. Otherwise, the authorization exception will be catched. Also, there are some functions could only be execute by some staff. For example, only manager can add staff or resident to the system, only nurse can move resident to other bed, only doctor can attach and update prescription to patient via bed number.

There is a function to show the status of bed in each ward. Blue as male, red as female and white as empty.
